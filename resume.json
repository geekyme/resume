    "summary": "Background in business and entrepreneurship. I am equipped with heavy technical knowledge in frontend, backend & infrastructure. Because of this unique intersection between business & software engineering, I can easily influence and win the trust of people from both sides. \n\nMy story began with a startup I founded to make writing more accessible and fun for everyone. Learning how to design and scale this website brought me towards a career in software engineering, a craft I truly enjoy up till this day. I was engineer #4 in Carousell (a Singapore unicorn company), built and scaled their web application from Singapore to the rest of SEA. Later on, I built from scratch high profile projects in several large companies. Currently, I am a Software Architect in Traveloka (an Indonesian unicorn) with organizational impact of 100+ engineers across multiple domains. \n\nPeople who have worked with me can usually spot my passion in honing my craft. While my primary interest is in designing systems that scale, I also enjoy mentoring other engineers and helping them expand their skills. Read more about what others say in my recommendations section.\n\nOn the side, I experiment with ideas and start my own projects. Many of which mainly serve to push myself beyond what I know. I also enjoy building interesting things in the open source world. See https://github.com/geekyme for some of my contributions.\n\nI share regularly about topics about Software Engineering.
